# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 18, 2019 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**:

Today I started chapter 5 of Python Crash Course and uploaded all exercises from chapters 1-4. 

**Thoughts:**
I started the 100dayscoding challenge back in July but didn't stick with it consistently. So I'm reforging my efforts to
master Python by first completing Python Crash Course then a Python Course I purchased on Udemy. I'll officially count 
this as day 0, let's get it!!

**Update
I think I will log my updates according to days vs chapters in the book. That structure may work better for me. I'll
reorganize it on the weekend because I don't want to take away from the focusing on just coding right now.
